# braessQlearning: exploring the potential of Self-Organization in routing games for circular, reinforcement learning systems.

This repository collects projects on Multi Agent Reinforcement Learning in Routing Games undertaken at the Computational Social Science group of ETHZ.

## What to expect from this repository
This repository is a stems from research and can be used to test various modes of reinforcement learning in routing games.  

- The `tabular` folder contains work on the braess paradox using tabular Q-learning. It also contains extensions testing recommender systems.
- The `dqn` folder contains an extension of the tabular work to arbitrarily large routing networks, which then uses deep Q-learning to model drivers.
