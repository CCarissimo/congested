# braessQlearning

This repository collects projects on Multi Agent Reinforcement Learning in Routing Games undertaken at the Computational Social Science group of ETHZ.

The -tabular folder contains work on the braess paradox using tabular Q-learning. It also contains extensions testing recommender systems.
The -dqn folder contains an extension of the tabular work to arbitrarily large routing networks, which then uses deep Q-learning to model drivers.
